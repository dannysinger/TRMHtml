            <p>Vs. The Regime</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>The Regime is a three headed dragon</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>All three heads grow directly out of it's ass</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>One of it's heads shoots quantum ice beams</p>
            <p>Another one is singing Katy Perry's firework on repeat</p>
            <p>The last one can do Jedi Mind Tricks, and Judo (pseudo)</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>The quantum ice beams are actually an extremely fast focused sound beam of hypnotism</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>The Jedi head actually has two heads that come out of the one</p>
            <p>Both secondary heads say the same mind trick except backwards and at the same time which confuses the victim's rational thinking while simultaneously instructing the dumber part of his mind</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>The Katy Perry head sings firework a different style each time which is always kind of fun.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>The dragon is pretty old</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>The ice head is only able to speed sound up to the freezing point through technical advances made by sony.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>KRS-One almost defeated the dragon in 1980, but he was sniped by one of the dragon's lawyers who were camped in the mountains nearby</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>The dragon also dances to whatever style groove the Katy Perry head is doing while playing drums with a few of it's three thousand arms.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Satan himself created the dragon</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Legend has it that to defeat the beast, one must invoke the spirit of Karl Marx while turning ADORNOb</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>There have been violin-wielding armies that have momentarily stunned the beast by playing webern.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>You may find yourself involuntarily beating yourself off in the dragon's presence - to whatever rhythm the katy perry groove is playing - Why? Because in a strange way, the dragon is your reflection, and you WANT to beat off.

            <p>Nobody knows why the paradox is true, but it is proven</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Adorno believes the dragon may have been our friend if it weren't for Sony and starbucks owning two of it's heads
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>All of the dragon's heads wear holographic fitted caps</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Each one of the dragon's heads is the reincarnation of an old European composer somehow.

         <div>
            <p>The Jedi mind trick head gets drunk (off of nothing) at least once a week. When it does, it recites the entire bible.
